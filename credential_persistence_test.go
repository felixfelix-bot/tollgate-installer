// Persistence half of the credential-lockout fix for
// OpenTollGate/tollgate-installer#46.
//
// The one-shot serve (handleStatus / main.go) fixes the case where the operator
// is sitting in front of the wizard. It does NOT fix the durability case, and
// that is the one that bit a real board: the credential exists only in memory
// and only until the first terminal /api/status read. Miss that read — the tab
// was closed, the poll consumed it while the operator was away, a crash or a
// Ctrl-C landed between the deploy and the success view — and the router is
// left holding a root password NOBODY has, on a device whose stock state was
// "log in with an empty password". The operator is then locked out of their own
// router by the tool that was supposed to configure it (observed on
// 192.168.23.1: root password unknown to everyone, no recovery path).
//
// The fix pinned here: the credential is written to an owner-only file BEFORE
// it is applied to the router, so no ordering of failure, crash, or a missed
// poll can produce a re-keyed router with a lost credential.
//
// Every assertion in this file is RED against the head it was written for.
