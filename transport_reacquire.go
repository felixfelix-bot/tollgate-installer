// Self-inflicted transport loss, and how the deploy now survives it.
//
// Step 10 (services) restarts networking ON THE ROUTER WE ARE DRIVING.
// tollgate-wrt's uci-defaults derive network.private from network.lan and reload
// the network, so the restart tears down the very SSH session that issued it.
//
// Observed on a GL-MT3000, 2026-10-05: the restart dropped the deploy interface's
// address, sshRun (nil-safe) swallowed the death, step 10 was reported DONE, and
// the failure only surfaced two steps later at the health gate as "lost the SSH
// transport" — which points the operator at a router that was never at fault and
// leaves them hunting for its new address by hand.
//
// Contract added here: after a step that knowingly restarts router networking,
// the deploy PROVES the session is alive; if it is not, it RE-ACQUIRES the
// transport within a bounded window before any later step runs.
// Vars, not consts: tests shrink the window so a give-up path is proved in
// milliseconds instead of minutes.
