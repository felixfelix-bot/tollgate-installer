// ─── Secret carriers ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Secrets that must reach the router (the root password, the WiFi STA
// SSID/passphrase) cross as OCTAL-ESCAPE carriers rather than shell string
// literals: the value is escaped host-side into `\0NNN` sequences and expanded
// on the router by the shell BUILTIN printf:
//
//	pw=$(printf '%b' '\0120\0141\0142')
//
// Why NOT a router-side base64 decode (the constraint that must not regress):
//
//   - Stock OpenWrt's BusyBox does NOT ship the base64 applet. In OpenWrt it is
//     the separate `coreutils-base64` package, absent from a stock image, so a
//     router-side base64 decode fails with `ash: base64: not found` on the
//     wizard's own documented target. The command substitution then returns
//     127, the `&&` chain short-circuits, passwd never runs at all, and the
//     fail-closed guard correctly aborts EVERY deploy at step 4 with an empty
//     credential. Reproduced by the reviewer E2E on a fresh stock OpenWrt
//     24.10.1 x86_64 VM, and locally against a stock 24.10.8 x86_64 rootfs
//     (BusyBox v1.36.1: 0/128 applet symlinks mention base64) —
//     OpenTollGate/tollgate-installer#46, review 5304937880.
//   - printf needs no router-side binary AT ALL. It is a builtin of BusyBox ash
//     (verified against stock OpenWrt 24.10.x /bin/busybox: `printf is a shell
//     builtin`) and of dash/bash, and `%b` with `\0NNN` octal escapes is POSIX.
//     Stock OpenWrt also ships /usr/bin/printf, so either resolution works.
//
// The carrier keeps both properties the base64 carrier was there for:
//
//	(a) no dependency on any router-side binary beyond the shell and what
//	    BusyBox ships by default;
//	(b) the plaintext never appears in the SSH command string (process argv and
//	    shell history on the router) and never participates in shell parsing, so
//	    a password or SSID cannot inject shell.
//
// Regression guards live in secret_carrier_test.go:
// TestRouterCommandsNeverDependOnBase64 fails if a base64 carrier comes back in
// a generated router command (or in deploy.go's code), and
// TestSecretCarrierRoundTripsWithoutAnyRouterBinary executes the SHIPPED command
// under a shell whose PATH is empty, so the secret must land byte-exact with no
// binary available at all.

// shellOctalCarrier returns s as `\0NNN` escapes for the shell builtin
// `printf '%b'`, which expands them back to s byte-for-byte. Every byte a shell
// variable can hold round-trips; NUL cannot (no shell carrier can carry it, the
// base64 one did not either).

// digits — so an escape is self-delimiting and can never run into the byte that
// follows it.

//   - the operator's chosen mint ($mu) is APPENDED if non-empty and not
//     already present (it never replaces the default list);
//   - every default mint ($dm) not already in accepted_mints is APPENDED
//     (idempotent by URL — re-running a deploy adds nothing new);
//   - a config.json without accepted_mints is handled via (// []).
//
// Fixes vs the previous filter, which NEVER wrote margin/profit_share/mints:
//  1. the dedup check inside `($dm | map(...))` referenced .accepted_mints
//     while `.` was bound to each $dm element (null) → "Cannot iterate over
//     null" on every router; the fix snapshots the CURRENT url list into
//     $have BEFORE appending defaults, and every access to .accepted_mints
//     is null-coalesced with `// []`;
//  2. `($mu != "" and $idx | not)` mis-parsed as `(cond) | not`, inverting
//     the condition so an EMPTY mint appended a {"url":""} entry; the fix
//     parenthesizes `(($mu != "") and (index == null))`;
//  3. the operator mint now crosses the shell SINGLE-QUOTED (see
//     shellQuoteSingle) — unquoted, an empty --arg value made jq consume the
//     filter itself as $mu, and a mint with a space/shell char corrupted the
//     whole command.

//
// Why the installer asks the ROUTER instead of minting here: this repo was a
// second mint. It generated a fresh code on every deploy and wrote only the
// hostname and the captive SSID, so a later deploy re-named a router that the
// module had already named (bench MT3000: hostname=tollgate-OQ3Q, open SSID
// re-minted to tollgate-0GLK, private SSID carrying a third suffix). Resolving
// on the router means the store is read and written in one place, by both
// writers, and the value cannot drift between them.
//
// Adoption order — identical to the module's, and pinned on both sides:
//
//  1. tollgate.device.code in /etc/config/tollgate   (authoritative)
//  2. a machine-shaped hostname                      (tollgate-OQ3Q)

//  4. mint                                           (only when nothing above hit)
//
// BusyBox ash only: no bashisms, no `od` (the target has no guarantee of it),
// no GNU sed. Every branch is a POSIX `case` so the same alphabet is enforced
