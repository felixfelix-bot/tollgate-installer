// discover_latency_test.go is the regression lock for the scan-latency defect
// measured on CobradorWave on 2026-10-05 with NO router attached:
//
//	shipped discoverRouters (sequential)   25.0 s / 29.0 s
//	route-aware candidate filter only       9.5 s
//	same probes, fanned out (16 workers)    5.0 s
//	route-aware + fanned out                4.1 s
//
// The cause was NOT slow routers: it was fixed timeout waste. `ip route get`
// showed 4 of the 6 shipped guesses route VIA THE DEFAULT GATEWAY (their subnets
// are absent here) → the SYN is blackholed → each one burned the full 2 s SSH
// probe plus 3 × 1 s HTTP probes = 5 s, serially. ~80 % of the scan was waiting
// for subnets that are not present.
//
// Three properties are pinned below, each against a host with no router:
//
//  1. a host costs the SLOWEST port probe, not the SUM of its ports;
//  2. a scan costs the slowest candidate WAVE, not the SUM of its candidates;
//  3. the per-port budget is a LAN budget (< 1 s), not the shipped 2 s/1 s.
//
// Plus the ordering contract: the default gateway is always a candidate and is
// ordered before every ARP-derived one, and an UNROUTABLE-by-default-gw
// candidate is DEMOTED (indexed after the directly-connected ones), never
// dropped.
